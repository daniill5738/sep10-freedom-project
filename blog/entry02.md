Ive been researching for software and hardware technologies for business, on how some gadgets or technologies can help make businesses so successful. So in the near future it will be really helpful for me as I can just look back at this and gain some inspiration.

# Hardware
To find hardware technologies, I googled "business gadgets" and found variety of hardware technologies and single picked them myself because it was more exotic than other hardware technologies. The first thing I found was a gadget called the ticktime which helps businesses keep track of things the exact moment they happen. Which makes work more efficiently, faster, and more organized. Furthermore, the way you use it is you flip the ticktime to set the time you want or even reset. Additonally, it is magnetic so you could place it on anything thats iron or steel. Moreover, It can be used for timing things like cooking food, making hot drinks , and more. The second one I choose that stood out to me was a penscanner, which is a pen shaped device that can scan text from books, papers, or screens, to turn it into a digital text. What it does is it can digitize text so you can copy it directly to a computer, tablet, or phone. Also, businesses can use it to quickly record information from documents, contracts, or receipts without typing everything out. Lastly, I picked the portable printer because its really useful as you dont have to carry around a whole pinter, instead you can use a portable printer which is a small and lightweight printer that can print documents anywhere. Which lets businesses print invoices, receipts, or reports on the spot and it is bluetooth so it can connect to computers, tablets, or even smartphones wirelessly.

# Software

# Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the first step is to research the problem. The problem I hope to solve with my project is that many people don’t fully understand how businesses work and what makes them successful. Furthermore, to research the problem, which to do this, is by searching up technologies that help business strategies, management, and growth. In the next step is to brainstorm a solution which I plan to talk to people to hear their thoughts on what makes a business run smoothly and how other successful people run their businesses. Overall, this will help me gain a better understanding of the topic and find different ways to find a solution.
