Ive been researching for software and hardware technologies for business, on how some gadgets or technologies can help make businesses so successful. So in the near future it will be really helpful for me as I can just look back at this and gain some inspiration.

# Hardware
To find hardware technologies, I googled "business gadgets" and found variety of hardware technologies and single picked them myself because it was more exotic than other hardware technologies. The first thing I found was a gadget called the [Ticktime](https://www.ticktime.store/) which helps businesses keep track of things the exact moment they happen. Which makes work more efficiently, faster, and more organized. Furthermore, the way you use it is you flip the [Ticktime](https://www.ticktime.store/) to set the time you want or even reset. Additionally, it is magnetic so you could place it on anything thats iron or steel. Moreover, It can be used for timing things like cooking food, making hot drinks , and more. The second one I chose that stood out was a [Penscanner](https://shop.penpowerinc.com/products/worldpenscan-wi-fi-pen-scanner), which is a pen shaped device that can scan text from books, papers, or screens, to turn it into a digital text. What it does is it can digitize text so you can copy it directly to a computer, tablet, or phone. Also, businesses can use it to quickly record information from documents, contracts, or receipts without typing everything out. Lastly, I picked the [portable printer](https://www.brother.com.au/en/blog/a-guide-to-portable-printers-for-mobile-workforces?srsltid=AfmBOorAUEo-lcNJX3gmSuTWTUmBttXl6HsDquyygNHNlAkm9Uhl7r8k&utm_source=chatgpt.com) because its really useful as you dont have to carry around a whole printer, instead you can use a [portable printer](https://www.brother.com.au/en/blog/a-guide-to-portable-printers-for-mobile-workforces?srsltid=AfmBOorAUEo-lcNJX3gmSuTWTUmBttXl6HsDquyygNHNlAkm9Uhl7r8k&utm_source=chatgpt.com) which is a small and lightweight printer that can print documents anywhere. Which lets businesses print invoices, receipts, or reports on the spot and it is bluetooth so it can connect to computers, tablets, or even smartphones wirelessly.

# Software
First I was asking my mom for what apps she could recommended me so I could use to grow a business in the future and doing this assignment. She recommended me that she uses [Slack](https://slack.com/) for centralized communication with her team, which will help her and her team brainstorm any ideas into the chat. Which it will increase efficiency of your ideas and business. In addition, I decided to researched other software technologies that are useful without getting any help from my mom because I dont wanna rely on her to much. I found an app called [Wave](https://www.waveapps.com/) which is a money management platform that is made for small business owners and freelancers. What it does is it tracks your income and expenses and makes tax preparation way easier as it records the information in one place.


# Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the first step is to research the problem. The problem I hope to solve with my project is that many people don’t fully understand how businesses work and what makes them successful. Furthermore, to research the problem, which to do this, is by searching up technologies that help business strategies, management, and growth. In the next step is to brainstorm a solution which I plan to talk to people to hear their thoughts on what makes a business run smoothly and how other successful people run their businesses. Overall, this will help me gain a better understanding of the topic and find different ways to find a solution.

# Skills

**Collaboration**

Collaboration has helped significantly while doing this blog. I asked my friend for support, in knowing what to research on what kind of business gadgets are useful and how they help people in businesses. Additionally, I was communicating with people and showed them my work to check my grammer in what I wrote and see if they were gonna give me any recommendations.

**Time Management**

For time management, I decided to choose November 9 because that was the day I had off because I have soccer practices and matches with my team on other days. When the day arrived I decided to start writing my blog entry and finish it before the due date.

# Summary
Overall, researching hardware and software business technologies was always been very fun and interesting for me because I've always been interested in how a business operates and be successful. I also want to learn more about business as it will give me new skills that will prepare me when the time is right. Furthermore, While developing my skills which are collaboration and time management which is really significant for helping or creating new business ideas.
