Ive been researching for software and hardware technologies for business, on how some gadgets or technologies can help make businesses so successful. So in the near future it will be really helpful for me as I can just look back at this and gain some inspiration.

# Hardware
To find hardware technologies, I googled "business gadgets" and found variety of hardware technologies and single picked them myself because it was more exotic than other hardware technologies. The first thing I found was a gadget called the ticktime which helps businesses keep track of things the exact moment they happen. Which makes work more efficiently, faster, and more organized. Furthermore, the way you use it is you flip the ticktime to set the time you want or even reset. Additonally, it is magnetic so you could place it on anything thats iron or steel. Moreover, It can be used for timing things like cooking food, making hot drinks , and more.
