# Business
The topic I decided to choose was business because I've always been interested in how other businesses work and how people can come up with creative ideas to make their business successful. Also, I always wanted to know more about business for a long time, since my mom's job is also in that same area. Furthermore, I thought about doing my project about sports or construction, but business just felt like the best fit for me as I just found it the most interesting topic out of them all. Researching all different kinds of topics was actually really interesting. Some of the articles I read was ["Impact of Technology on Business"](https://www.herzing.edu/blog/impact-technology-business) by the Herzing University,["Research: Technology Is Changing How Companies Do Business"](https://business.cornell.edu/hub/2024/05/16/research-technology-is-changing-how-companies-do-business/) by the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, and ["Business Technology Impact: How Technology Shapes Business Success"](https://tsttechnology.io/blog/business-technology-impact) by TST Technology. As all the articles were really interesting and significant for building a business. Out of all the sources that I read, [How technology is changing the landscape of economic development](https://researchfdi.com/how-technology-is-changing-the-landscape-of-economic-development/) Out of all the sources that I read, this one helped open my eyes that it is the most influential one and helped me gain so much more knowledge about business, as it also made me enjoy this topic more.

# Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem I hope to solve with my project is that many people donâ€™t fully understand how businesses work and what makes them successful. Furthermore, to research the problem, which to do this, is by reading the articles I provided or the internet about business strategies, management, and growth. I also plan to talk to people to hear their thoughts on what makes a business run smoothly and how other successful people run their businesses. Overall, this will help me gain a better understanding of the topic and find different ways to find a solution.

# Skills
Some of the skills I've developed while working on my business project are time management, communication, and how to Google. These skills are engaged in my everyday life and not only to help me with this project.

**Creativity**

 While working on this project it has helped me develop creativity by thinking outside the box and the new different kinds of ways that businesses can improve or grow. Also making me come up with new ideas for improving business strategies. This pushed me to think outside the box and consider possible solutions.

 **Organization**
 
Organization has taught me valuable skills by learning how to plan and manage my work more effectively and creating schedules to keep track of work that has to be done, so I don't fall behind. I also organize all my notes, ideas, etc., to help me stay focused and not confused. Which is very significant, not only for this project but for the future.

**Communication**

Communication is also a key skill because conversations help people understand the different perspectives of the business and gather their ideas to make the business more successful and stronger. Additionally, being able to share ideas and collaborate with other co-workers will improve your working habits.
