# Business
The topic I decided to choose was business because I've always been interested in how other businesses work and how people can come up with creative ideas to make their business successful. Also I always wanted to know more about business for a long time, since my moms job is also in that same area. Furthermore, I thought about doing my project about sports or construction, but business just felt like the best fit for me as I just found it the most interesting topic out of them all. Researching all different kinds of topics were actually really interesting. Some of the articles I read was ["Impact of Technology on Business"](https://www.herzing.edu/blog/impact-technology-business) by the Herzing University,["Research: Technology Is Changing How Companies Do Business"](https://business.cornell.edu/hub/2024/05/16/research-technology-is-changing-how-companies-do-business/) by the Cornell SC Johnson College of Business, and ["Business Technology Impact: How Technology Shapes Business Success"](https://tsttechnology.io/blog/business-technology-impact) by TST Technology. As all the articles were really interesting and significant for building a business. Out of all the sources that I read, [How technology is changing the landscape of economic development](https://researchfdi.com/how-technology-is-changing-the-landscape-of-economic-development/) this one helped open my eyes that it is the most influential one and helped me gain so much more knowledge about business, as it also made me enjoy this topic more.

# Engineering Design Process
I am currently in the first stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to define the problem. The problem to solve with my project is that lots of people don't fully understand how technology will affect business and how it can improve the way a business works. As the next stage is to research the problem which to do this is by reading the articles I provided or the internet about business technology. I also plan to talk to people,as to hear their thoughts on how technology has changed how people work and run their businesses. Overall, this will help me gain a better understanding of the issue and ways to solve it.
