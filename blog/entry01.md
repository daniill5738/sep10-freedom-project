<h1>Busines</h1>
<p>The topic I decided to choose was busines because I've always been interested in how other business work and how people can come up with creative ideas to make their busines successful. Also I always wanted to know more about business for a long time, since my moms job is also in that same area. Furthermore, I thought about doing my project about sports or construction, but business just felt like the best fit for me as I just found it the most interesting topic out of them all. Researching all different kinds of topics were actually really interesting. Some of the articles I read was <a href=”#”>Impact of Technology on Business</a> </p>
